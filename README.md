Repository for work on OCR'ed texts of Ecevit's journalism, 1950-1960.

In the `ocr` directory, files are grouped in subdirectories by year of publication.

Files are plain-text files stripped from the OCR source using the OS X 
`textutil` utility.  Source files are in either .docx format or .rtf 
format.  NB!  File names ending in .doc are actually in .rtf format!
