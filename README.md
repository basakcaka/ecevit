Repository for work on OCR'ed texts of Ecevit's journalism, 1950-1960.

In the `ocr` directory, files are grouped in subdirectories by year of publication.

Files are plain-text files stripped from the OCR source using the OS X 
`textutil` utility. The source files are *not* checked into this repostiory.

OCR source files were in either .docx format or .rtf format.  
NB! OCR file names ending in .doc were actually in .rtf format!
